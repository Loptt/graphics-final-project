Going Merry Driver is a simulation of the Going Merry, the first ship of the Straw Hat crew from One Piece. In the simulation, you can control the ship and drive it across a sea with several procedurally generated islands.

## Requirements
- Any web browser that has support for WebGL.
- Recommended to have a graphics card as the simulator is resource intensive.
- It is recommended to have hardware acceleration enabled in the browser. See this [tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/412738/how-to-turn-hardware-acceleration-on-and-off-in-chrome/) for instructions for Chrome.

## Controls
### Camera
- Click and drag the screen to move the camera around
- Use the mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll in and out to zoom in and out

### Ship
- Use the Up arrow key to increase the Going Merry's speed forward
- Use the Down arrow key to decrease the Going Merry's speed forward
- Use the Left and Right arrow keys to steer the ship. You can only steer it when the ship is in motion.
- Watch out for the islands.
